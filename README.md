# FPDA
Attacking networks with the MIM and directional protocols

# How it works
By using MIM, an attacker can store raw packets within a socket and then push them out to a connection. This can be used to send large DOS attacks towards a connection while using port 25.

By storing raw packets, the attacker can send a malicious DOS towards the victim, resulting in a large wholesome barrage of packets to the victim router. I've tested this out before and I've reached a max packet size of 2.3TBps.

This tool will be usable on a server and thus be used to create large botnets. Similar to the Mirai and Reaper.

# Installing & Pre-requirements










# TODO

* Create localhost port 8080 to be opened on attack.c access for browser and graphical control
* Allow for multiple connections to manage users to use for a sell point.
